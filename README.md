### SMPLY Navigate

Overview:

The project aims to create an app that uses Western University's floor plans, allowing users to search and navigate each floor of select buildings. The application will allow users to search for points of interest, browse floor maps, and save personal points of interest. The application will also have an editing tool for developers to create and edit map metadata. This document outlines the general project specifications.
